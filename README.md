# portfolio

Some toy code that reads in a CSV file of ticker symbols and the desired
fraction of each in an investment portfolio. After specifying the total
cash available to invest and currency using the parameters below, the
script uses Yahoo! Finance to retrieve share prices and (if necessary)
a currency exchange rate. Given the desired fraction of each share in the
portfolio, the script determines the quantity of shares to buy.
